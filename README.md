# A customizable Vencord theme

Shiggycord is a theme for the Discord client mod Vencord. It includes full modularity, optimized performance and high functionality and customizability

If you are not experienced with CSS and don't want to be overwhelmed by variables, since I make basically everything with variables, use the Shiggycord.theme.css file.
Of course, every snippet included in Shiggycord has default values for it's variables that come with the snippet, which means you can even just use NO variables and use my, objectively perfect subjective preferences.
If you are interested in more advanced and detailed variables, you can replace the variables from Shiggycord.theme.css with the variables out of Shiggycordvariables.css

This Theme is only supported for Vencord, feel free to commit with versions that work for Betterdiscord, as well as fixes and improvements
